This solution for LeetCode 1262 – Greatest Sum Divisible by Three uses a greedy strategy by first calculating the total sum and then separating numbers based on their remainder when divided by 3. If the sum is not divisible by 3, we remove the smallest possible value that fixes the remainder—either the smallest element from the remainder-1 or remainder-2 groups, or the sum of the two smallest elements from the other group. After sorting these groups to ensure minimal removal, we subtract the smallest valid adjustment from the total sum to get the maximum sum divisible by 3.
