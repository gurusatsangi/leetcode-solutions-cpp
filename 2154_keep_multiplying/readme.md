# my startegy
I solved this problem using two approaches. The first method is based on sorting, where sorting the array groups identical elements together, making it simple to scan and identify the required value. The second method uses map/set, allowing efficient counting or tracking of elements in O(n) time without modifying the original data. Both approaches work correctly: the sorting method is straightforward and easy to understand, while the map/set method is faster and more optimized for large inputs.
